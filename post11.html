    <p class="text-left"><strong>A remake of 1974 Gone in 60 seconds.</strong></p>

    <p class="text-left">1967 Ford Mustang used during the filming of the 2000’s hit movie Gone in 60 Seconds has sold at auction for a staggering $1 million.
      This was no ordinary Mustang, however, as the car in question was none other than the famous ‘Eleanor’ Mustang driven by actor Nicholas Cage in the movie’s closing stages.
      Eleven of the fictional Eleanor Mustangs were created for the movie, although only three of these were working cars, and two of these were destroyed during
      filming.</p>

    <p class="text-left">This one was Cage’s primary ‘beauty’ car, used mostly for close-ups as well as promotional efforts.
      The car was sold during the Dana Mecum 26th Original Spring Classic Auction in Indianapolis in 2013. Of those 11 cars,
      just three authentic cars are known to still exist, while countless replicas have been created over the years.</p>

    <p class="text-left">No details about the auction’s winner have been announced, though the price paid is not at all unexpected given the car’s fame as well
      as its pedigree. Though not an original Shelby, the Eleanor Mustangs was based on a 1967 Mustang
      fastback and was built by Cinema Vehicle Services with the help of legendary coachbuilders and hot rod legends Steve Stanford and Chip Foose.</p>

    <p class="text-left">Key features of the car are its central-mounted driving lights, pumped fender flares, and unique hood and trunk.
        Power comes from a 351 Ford Racing V8 engine, rated at 400 horsepower.
        Other specs include lowered suspension with coil-overs, 17-inch wheels shod with Goodyear F1 tires, and a faux NOS kit. Included in the sale
        was the certification of the vehicle’s authenticity from the company responsible for building it as well as a special plaque that includes the VIN.</p>

    <p class="text-left">You don’t have to spend a million to get an impressive “Eleanor,” though. Fusion Motor Company, just north of Los Angeles,
      makes new versions of the old Mustang. The bodies are original 1967 and 1968 models that Feldman and his staff find in fields and barns and
      back alleys; the suspension and chassis are updated at the shop near Los Angeles; all the wiring, welding, fabrication,
      engine and transmission work, and interior trimming are hand-done in a house in L.A.</P>

    <p class="text-left">Even the (disconnected) NOS tank in the trunk of the car
      is made to exact historical specifications. If you pay more money, you can choose to have a supercharged 600hp or 750hp V8 version.</p>

    <p class="text-left">This Mustang has an odd connection to the “Bullit” Mustang cause one of the two Mustangs used for the Shooting of Steve Mcqueen thriller
      was found rotting away in Mexico by a custom car builder looking to build an exact replica of this Eleanor Mustang.
      That one is currently undergoing a full restoration and will be heading to an auction somewhere later this year.</p>
