    <p class="text-left">As you, I'm sure have experienced this at some point in your life, maybe even now, conversing doesn't seem like a very efficient way to exchange ideas between two people or more for that matter.
      For some of you, this might not be the case if you're good at talking your way through any situation.
      But imagine you trying to explain a complex idea to someone, often you'll struggle to do that because it's not easy to explain something
      like that to someone using just words. 9 out of 10 times you're going to end up confusing that person with too many words.</p>

    <p class="text-left">That's why we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">Unified Modelling Language (UML)</a> in software engineering to explain complex ideas to others. Even to yourself,
      it helps if you draw a diagram to illustrate the idea, it's easy to keep track of things and know what's what.</p>

    <p class="text-left">We're conversing to exchange ideas between one another because as human civilization moved forward, it was the best way to communicate. It's true we use different languages to communicate around the world. But If you think
      about it, all those languages have three things in common. Letters,
      Words, Sentences. As humans, It was what's natural. But wouldn't it be better if we had a way to share thoughts to who we want when we want?
      Like instant messaging?</p>

    <p class="text-left">I know… I know…. Now we're in the “Sci-Fi” territory. But this train of thought has gone through my mind so many times.
      This can be immensely helpful for people with mutism, hearing-impairedness, and blindness. Even if we aren't able to talk, hear or see,
      we humans have the ability to visualize things. Tapping into this idea can be the way to unlocking a broad range of things we can do that
      we never thought we could.</p>

    <p class="text-left">There are so many technical difficulties when we talk about such an idea. In the same sense that two people will never have the same mobile number, there should be a way to identify each person in the world individually. That
      is assuming such a scenario where all 7 billion people in the world having a device with such capabilities.
      I have to specifically state that this is one of the many red flags and just a glimpse of what a device like this is capable of.</p>

    <p class="text-left">I'm sure now that Elon Musk has an entire company with a team of scientists dedicated to this idea, we will see this happening sooner than we expected.
      The company which was founded back in 2016 was coined the name <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink.</a>
      If you look at the track record of this guy, you'll know that you can't really argue with his results.
      So, his company is currently developing and I'm quoting them directly
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>“A fully-implanted, wireless, high-channel-count brain-machine interface
        (BMI) with the goal of enabling people with paralysis to directly use their neural activity to operate computers and mobile devices
        with speed and ease.”</strong> </a>


    <p class="text-left">This is their plan for the first few iterations and according to Elon Musk,
      their BMI device will be capable of a great many things in the future.
      If you wanna know what it will be capable of exactly, see for yourself. Here's my favorite quote from the demo.</p>

      <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p class="mb-0"> The future is going to be weird</p>
    <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">Elon Musk</cite></footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="text-left">Apparently, sharing thoughts back and forth will be just one of the many great features that come with it.</p>

  <p class="text-left">Take a look at this video to get a glimpse of what their BMI will be capable of eventually.</p>
