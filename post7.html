      <img src="buying-second-hand.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Dead D-Link Gigabit Switch">
      <p class="caption"><small>Link Status bulbs blinking away for no reason ðŸ˜¢</small></p>

      <p class="text-left">Recently I faced an unfortunate incident regarding a D -Link Gigabit Switch (DGS-1016D, Unmanaged) which I bought second-hand.
        I did a thorough research about this particular device before deciding on it and I asked for a one-month checking warranty from the guy I bought it from.
        He agreed to it, further cementing my confidence about this deal.
        Fast forward a few days, I got the device and gave it power, and connected it to my network..
        Sure enough, the device worked fine.</p>

      <p class="text-left">I did some stress testing with some heavy chunks of files copying across the network, the device took it like a champ.
        This particular model was a fanless design and heated up a little during the test but it was normal for this..
        (I looked up the operational temps from the manual and it was well within those temp ranges.)
        And it averaged about 100â€“110MBs of transfer speeds throughout the process. I was very happy with the deal.</p>


      <p class="text-left">This device ran 24/7 for 42 days straight during which it was not under pressure and the important thing was that this switch was fed power through an online UPS. So I can rule out the possibility of this being a power
        surge.
        On the 43rd day, it literally gave up on me. The weird thing is that it never died, but it just went haywire.
        7 out of 16 link status lights kept blinking even though, those ports are not occupied with any device whatsoever.</p>

      <p class="text-left">The other 9 ports didnâ€™t work altogether. To this day I couldnâ€™t find what went wrong with it, I canâ€™t return it cause my checking warranty was up by then.
        I tried opening it up and blowing air into it to getting rid of the dust. But it never recovered.
        I even went ahead and checked the power supply of it with a multimeter to see if it gets the rated voltage. It did. The PSU was fine.</p>

      <p class="text-left">Factory refurbished means that the device was checked for errors from both the software/firmware side and from the hardware side.
        If youâ€™re lucky enough you can even get a warranty for the said device from the company.
        I think thatâ€™s a pretty good habit to get into, every time you can manage such a scenario.</p>

<h3 class="text-left post2-h1"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

      <p class="text-left">Buying second-hand is a good idea and a practice, it helps you save money.
        But this depends on the use case, the country you live in, and the device you're going to buy.
        Even if you buy something brand new, pay extra and get at least three years of warranty for the device, if you have that option available.</p>

      <p class="text-left">And pay close attention to what type of warranty you're getting for your device.
        That habit has the potential to save tons of money and a world of pain in the future.
        I felt like sharing this experience with you guys. If you can get something from it, take it. That's my intention behind writing this article.</p>
